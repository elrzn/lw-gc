* lw-gc

This project provides a graphical interface in order to ease the
tuning of the LispWorks GC.

** Features

It currently displays the amount of allocated data as well as the
fragmentation state for each generation. The user has the option to
perform a full collection or target a given generation.

Actual GC tuning options, plotting and tracing may be implemented
later on.
